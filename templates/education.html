              CheHerma Student Sponsorship Fund enables the organization to provide access to quality education to selected vulnerable children from extremely poor families within the slum settlements. Under this program, the organization formulates initiatives such as monthly fundraisers and one off donations from well wishers that will enable us to offer educational support from primary school levels to collage levels
              . Sponsored children are selected through home visits which we at CheHerma do as part of having an understanding of the needs and their wellbeing. Vulnerable children enrolled under this program will also benefit from our healthcare programs.

              At Cheherma Foundation, we believe every child deserves a chance to learn, grow, and dreamâ€”regardless of where they were born. In many underserved communities, poverty, gender inequality, and lack of resources continue to rob children of their right to quality education.
              Your support can rewrite their future.
