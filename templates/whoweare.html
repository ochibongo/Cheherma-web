            Established by professionals passionate about equity and inclusion, our foundation works at the grassroots level to close the gap in health and social outcomes. We believe that real change happens when communities are empowered to lead their own transformation.

            From organizing medical outreach camps to supporting digital health access, education sponsorship, advocacy, and food security initiatives â€” Cheherma stands as a beacon of hope and impact.

          <p>
            We work hand-in-hand with local partners, volunteers, donors, and health professionals to ensure every intervention is people-centered, respectful, and sustainable.
